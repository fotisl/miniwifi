A library for communicating with the Mini WiFi firmware for ESP8266 devices.

Compared to the standard AT firmware, this library is much smaller, has more functionalities, and should be easier to use. Furthermore, many of the standard libraries for the AT firmware are compatible only with specific versions of the firmware, since the AT commands change.

# Usage

For the moment, there is no official documentation. Please check the sources. It should be pretty easy to understand how it works.

# Notes

This is just a by-product of another project I have been working on. Since the standard libraries I found were too big, and most of them were compatible with a single version of the AT firmware, I decided to write my own.

Not all functions have been tested that much. Furthermore, no official documentation exists yet. If you have any requests, free free to open an issue. Pull requests are also welcome.
